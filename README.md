# Vigenere-in-windows-forms-with-inputs

Essentially I've taken the basic code from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#C.23
and modified it to take inputs from a Windows Form. 

Need to add some error catching for blank inputs. 

Version 2 should have a dropdown for different versions of the Vigenere cipher.
